# Our goal is to integrate students at Radboud!

We noticed a division at our university between international and Dutch students. We propose an idea to integrate the students with the help of healthy activities! By this, we hope to improve studentâ€™s social lives. So, our proposal can be linked to SDG 3: Good health and wellbeing and SDG 10: Reduced inequalities. This idea is innovative since it combines the social opportunity with the chance to join sporty events for all students! We propose to first see how this idea works among students studying at the Faculty of Management and then extend the opportunity to all students!

We plan to do this by introducing bi-weekly sport events to 18-26 year old students, but mainly the first and second years. Now, the only big sport event for all (new) students is held during the Orientation week. By offering bi-weekly sport events, we hope to make sure that students will get to know their teammates well enough to make friends, but also to focus on letting students have time for other activities as well. The sports activities can range from volleyball to swimming for example.

Since the events can be held at university with the help of material which is already available over there, the costs of the activities can be held quite low. Moreover, due to the scale of the project, when students pay a small amount, a large sum of money will be available to help pay for larger projects. Therefore, the viability of the project is high. 

In order to advertise the event, we  make use of the RU international office for advertising. When the events have been planned, they will be offered to the students living in a radius of around 30 km from the RU to make sure that it will also be easy for people to meet up next to their studies.
```
With this project, we hope to give students an extra opportunity to live their best student life by offering social and healthy opportunities to them!
